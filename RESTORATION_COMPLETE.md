# ✅ Code Restored to Original Landing Page

## Changes Made

### 1. **App.jsx** - Restored to Landing Page Structure
The main App component now includes all the original sections:
- Navbar
- Hero (with "Detect Phishing Before It Steals Your Data")
- ProblemStatement ("The Problem We're Solving")
- DashboardPreview ("Scan Results Dashboard")
- HowItWorks ("How PhishEye Works")
- Features ("Key Features")
- Impact ("Who Benefits from PhishEye?")
- Stats (48,500+ scans, 12,300+ threats, 95% accuracy)
- About ("Built for SUBATHON 26")
- CTA ("Check Before You Click")
- Footer

### 2. **index.css** - Restored Tailwind Configuration
- Restored `@import "tailwindcss"`
- Custom theme colors for primary (indigo), safe (green), suspicious (amber), risky (red)
- Custom component classes: `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.section-container`, `.card`, `.badge-*`

### 3. **Removed Files**
- Deleted `src/App.css` (not needed for Tailwind version)
- The PhishEye-specific components (InputSection, ResultDisplay) are still in the components folder but not being used

## Current State

- White background with indigo accents

- And all other sections from the original design
