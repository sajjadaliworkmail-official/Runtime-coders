# PhishEye Professional Landing Page - DONE ✅

## 🚀 Live Demo
Your app is running at: **http://localhost:5175**

## 🎨 What Was Built
I have completely rebuilt the frontend to meet your "professional landing page" requirement.

### 1. Modern Tech Stack
- **React 18** + **Vite** (Fast, modern)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first styling)
- **Framer Motion** (Smooth animations)
- **Custom Components** (No generic UI libraries)

### 2. Key UI Features (Judge-Ready)
- **Sticky Navbar**: Scrolls smoothly to sections.
- **Hero Section**: Animated dashboard preview card showing real-time risk analysis.
- **Dashboard Preview**: Professional table layout with color-coded risk badges.
- **How It Works**: 3-step visual guide.
- **Features Grid**: Hover effects and icons.
- **Impact Section**: Use cases for students/beginners.
- **Live Stats**: Count-up animation for credibility.
- **About Section**: Hackathon context (SUBATHON 26).
- **Interactive CTA**: Input field for trying the demo.
- **Footer**: Proper project links.

### 3. Clean Code Structure
- All components are in `src/components/`.
- `App.jsx` cleanly assembles the page.
- `index.css` handles Tailwind directives.
- Unused files cleaned up or documented.

## 📝 Next Steps
- Open **http://localhost:5175** to view the result.
- Check `README.md` for project details.
- Review `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` for architecture info.

The application is now visually stunning and ready for presentation! 🚀
